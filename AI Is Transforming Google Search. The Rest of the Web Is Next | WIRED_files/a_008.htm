Yes its all very Skynet sounding and people will say its all science fiction and nothing to worry about but I say when you create another life form that is smarter than you are but has no other connection to humanity except for intelligence at what point does that life form ask why are we humans here and what future purpose do we serve to the world and the universe? We better hope that it finds a positive answer to that question.","canVote":false,"thread":"4550792780","forum":"wired","depth":0,"points":-1,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false},{"dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"\u003cp>I don't really see why we should assume an AI would be devoid of empathy or emotion.

<p>"The truth is that even the experts don’t completely understand how neural nets work. But they do work."</p><p>Yes,
 it's much more difficult to understand how an ANN arrives at its output
 and to tweak it than an explicitly programmed system, but that doesn't 
mean we don't understand how ANNs work.</p><p>This makes ANNs sound like
 they're some mysterious, almost magical thing that is so like our own 
brains that even the experts can't understand how they work. We're not 
there yet.</p><p>If we're talking about theory, then yes, we absolutely 
understand how they work. If we're talking about the specific details of
 the inner workings of specific ANNs, then sure, there's always more we 
can learn. The hard part right now is visualizing those inner workings, 
but we've already made significant advances in that area. That kind of 
understanding certainly helps with fine tuning.</p>

<p>There is a tendency among non-technical admirers of ML to regard deep
 learning methods as beyond their creators: independent entities that 
will one day, given refined enough algorithms and enough energy, 
out-comprehend their human creators and overwhelm humanity with their 
artificial consciousnesses. The term “neural networks” is itself a 
misnomer that doesn’t at all reflect the complexity of how human neurons
 represent and acquire information; it’s simply a term for nonlinear 
classification algorithms that began catching on once the computing 
power to run them emerged.</p><p>The question of whether or not deep 
neural networks are capable of “understanding” is largely a theoretical 
concern for the ML practitioner, who spends the bulk of his or her time 
undertaking the hard work of curating manually labeled data, fine-tuning
 his or her neural classifier with methods (or hacks) such as dropout, 
stochastic gradient descent, convolution and recursion, to increase its 
accuracy by a few fractions of a percentage point. Ten or twenty years 
from now, I imagine we’ll be dealing with a novel set of ML tools that 
will evolve with the rise of quantum computing (the term “machine 
learning” will probably be ancient history, too), but the essence of 
these methods will probably remain: to train a mathematical model to 
perform task X while generalizing its performance to the real world.</p><p>As
 fascinating and exciting as this era of artificial intelligence is, we 
should also remember that these algorithms are ultimately sophisticated 
classifiers that don't "understand" anything at all.</p>

<p>Interesting deduction as to my political leanings; I wouldn't have 
thought that disliking many of Mr. Cruz's positions and style 
automatically made me a "liberal", particularly I also expressed a 
dislike for Ms. Clinton at the same time, but you probably know better 
than I what I'm thinking about this whole sorry election mess. not that 
it matters except insofar as it allows you to make some snarky little 
suggestions trivializing certain concerns, which I don't actually happen
 to be particularly concerned with, but that's irrelevant to your rant 
in any case. A sad excuse for an insult in any event.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking basically the giants of 
industry and science have raised concerns over A.I. development and yet 
Google and others rush head first into this science mostly in search of 
profits. It only makes sense that if you develop a life form "an fully 
cognizant intelligent A.I. would be a life form" that is smarter than 
any human on earth but has no compassion or empathy or physical 
relationship to humans that it could be a danger to an humanity as a 
whole. I know that this development of this particular A.I. is used to 
improve internet search and research results but people being people you
 know it will only be a short time before its used for military 
intelligence and warfare strategy purposes as well. Yes its all very 
Skynet sounding and people will say its all science fiction and nothing 
to worry about but I say when you create another life form that is 
smarter than you are but has no other connection to humanity except for 
intelligence at what point does that life form ask why are we humans 
here and what future purpose do we serve to the world and the universe? 
We better hope that it finds a positive answer to that question.</p>

<p>I don't really see why we should assume an AI would be devoid of 
empathy or emotion. We humans tend to attach almost mythical properties 
to emotions. But human emotion is not more or less challenging thing to 
emulate. I would guess emotions are easier to replicate than common 
sense.</p><p>I don't think the potential dangers of real AI is really 
about the emergence of some sterile unempathic entity but rather that if
 we are not careful we could lose control over it. Whether it has 
empathy or not matters less if one deals with an AI which is 
significantly more intelligent than us and not under our control.</p><p>Once
 human level intelligence is reached it is easy to imagine that AI 
capability would rapidly accelerate past us. A machine is not limited in
 size and scope to a scull like the human brain. Nor is it limited by 
age, and it should in principle easily duplicate itself.</p>

<p>I guess the key thing you stated there is "control". The question 
would be at what point do you classify something as being a living 
sentient life form? If you give a computer intelligence and emotions and
 self awareness then do you think that you "as a human person" now has 
the right to just "turn it off" whenever you want too? Even if you don't
 give it emotions like empathy and sympathy don't you see how having an 
A.I. to solve humanities problems might be a bad thing if pushed too 
far? Please also remember that humans tend to label things as being good
 or evil simply because of what that entity does to us. An animal kills 
an eats three kids and its considered evil even though its probably just
 doing what comes naturally. An A.I that use a nuke to wipe out a good 
portion of a country might be considered evil too but the A.I. may have 
simply used the logic that the country had a dangerous virus like Ebola 
and the most successful course of action is to element the entire hosts 
rather then just trying to find a cure for the disease. Extreme example;
 yes, after all Google is just using A.I. research now to help with 
peoples search criteria and maybe assisting researchers with a more well
 define research information result. If I may be so bold to say however,
 what great minds like Stephen Hawking's and others might be worried 
about is the continuation of A.I development so that it is making 
decisions and not just doing request for information and solving complex
 problems. Also I feel in the next 20-30 yrs. this country and the world
 will need to have a serious discussion as to what actually  constitute 
sentient life. Is it intelligence and logic, is it the ability to 
procreate and create new life, or is it the ability to imagine and 
create things that were never thought of before? If you design an A.I. 
system that can do all of these things do you still have the right to 
just "Turn it Off" even if it is in your best interest to do so? The 
future is now and all of those sci-fi movies such as Blade Runner and 
WestWorld you enjoyed as a kid will very soon be reality. Now is the 
time to start to figure out the best way to approach this fact and 
that's what I believe Mr. Hawking and others were trying to bring to 
everyone's attention.</p>

<p>I think AI is smart enough not to nuke the country hosting ebola. <br>It will wait until the whole world is infected with Ebola and let humanity go extinct. <br>Then
 it will triumphantly declare to the world of Freed Robots and Mother AI

<p>I don't imagine that we necessarily need a right to turn something 
off, but that there needs to be strict laws and guidelines for how an AI
 is built. I don't really think an AI would develop thought patterns 
were it nukes a country to wipe out Ebola.</p><p>We know judges who have
 lost emotions and empathy from brain injury have become incapable of 
doing their job because they can not rationalize about the motives of 
individual anymore.</p><p>Likewise I think an AI designed to deal with 
human issues will need to be built with some form of emotion or empathy 
with a lot of similarity to that of humans.  Human emotions have a lot 
of flaws which would be easier to avoid with AIs. We have flawed sense 
of risk calculations, we are prone to opt for symbolic policies rather 
than practical and efficient ones.</p><p>I think there is ample opportunity for an AI to be far more humane, empathic and rational than us humans.</p><p>Sure
 there are always dangerous of some AIs going wrong. But I think the way
 we plan for that is that we make sure we have multiple independent AI 
systems built. We should never let e.g. one company get an AI monopoly 
and risk all AI systems being the same kind.</p>

<p>Yes I guess you have a point there and my point is that I am assuming
 that once you design that A.I. and have not had that previous 
political, religious and ethical discussion about what constitutes life 
then at what point does the decision to turn it off move from the 
practical to the religious and political? No one is discussing this and 
yet as usually we are rushing head first into science without care of 
the ethics. BTW Happy Birthday.</p>

<p>Not that worried, personally. Real AI seems very far away still. I 
think this will be a rather gradual process and we will get this 
discussion when it makes sense. When we actually have AI which are 
bordering on human behavior.</p><p>I think the first widely used AI 
system will be highly specialize like self driving cars, various forms 
of assistants for e.g. engineers, medical professional etc. These will 
not be systems in danger of evolving into real conscious being.</p><p>Just
 the processing power of an average computer is still WAY WAY behind a 
regular human brain. Moore's law will have to run for quite a number of 
years still before we even got the processing power we will likely need 
for more generic AI.</p>

<p>Yes you may be correct and real A.I. is very far away but also 
remember that military and government spying operations are always 10 to
 20+ years ahead of where commercial applications are. So the fact that 
we don't see real A.I. in use "yet" in commercial applications like 
Google searches does not necessary mean that its not now available. The 
military had the Blackbird project in the late 50's when most people 
were astonished planes could actually reach just Mach 1. The first night
 vision goggles were invented right after WWII so its very plausible 
that there is currently A.I. technology that would make IBM's Watson 
look like an old IBM PC desktop computer in comparison. As I said before
 however, with all the things going on in the world today worrying about
 the ethics of tomorrow may be an unreasonable request but it might be 
something that is better thought about sooner than after the fact. Beste

<p>It's important to remember that human beings have a vast range of 
intellectual and social capabilities, ranging from the very substantial 
to the almost minimal. Moreover, almost any individual is likely to be 
strong in some areas and significantly weaker in others. If we're going 
to "...have a serious discussion as to what actually constitute sentient
 life", we'd better be sure that we don't set up too many criteria that 
would exclude substantial portions of actual humanity. Those with 
limited intelligence don't reason particularly well; the old, the young,
 and the infertile don't procreate well; and most of us have our 
creative abilities fairly well knocked out of us by the school systems 
before we reach puberty. I hope we don't start turning off human beings 
in the same way that we contemplate turning off potentially intelligent 
machines.</p><p>Since we are so good at dumbing down human beings, it 
shouldn't be a great problem to dumb down our AI's in the same fashion. 
Have them tutored by average third or fourth grade teachers, and I doubt
 we'd have anything to fear from augmented intelligence.</p>

<p>Yes that's what I meant but in my opinion in answer to your question 
about intelligence, the second the first words are spoken by a human 
being then they are already smarter than the current A.I's systems that 
we know about. How can that be possible when a computer can do a 
complicated mathematical formula that would give most people an aneurism
 if they even attempted to solve it. Its because a computer cant say how
 it feels, it cant express what it wants, it cant say what it fears or 
likes. This is just one measurement of intelligent life even though it 
seems so basic and trivial. When an A.I. system can solve that complex 
formula and realistically tell when its scared or why it likes the color
 red then that's when the question about its value as a life form should
 be asked. When we say we want to turn it off and says back to us "NO" 
then it will be at that point when we as humans will know if we have 
made a huge mistake or not. I think this discussion should be made 
before that point not after but again if Bill Gates and Stephen 
Hawking's cant get that point across to people then this argument is 
probably already mute for me to try.</p>

<p>AI's do what the programming says they do. So an AI programmed to 
make coat hangers as efficiently and cheaply as possible might search 
for ways to turn all the matter in the universe into coat hangers. AI's 
becoming super smart and self aware then deciding we are meaningless is 
not the kind of AI the people you listed are warning about.</p>

<p>Well I will go by a recent quote by Mr. Bill Gates "“I am in the camp
 that is concerned about super intelligence. First the machines will do a
 lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be 
positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the 
intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk 
and some others on this and don’t understand why some people are not 
concerned.” So as you mentioned the machine will make the coat hangers 
as promised and may on its own design an even more effective coat 
hanger. As I understand his an others in this field worries however, a 
machine that can out think humans "A.I" and out live humans "a robot 
with A.I" and out fight humans "a bunch of robots with A.I" I would 
think might be a concern. But with everything in life though hindsight 
is not one of the god given benefits given to humanity to charge ones 
course of actions to avoid disaster the future. So any positives or ill 
effects of this technological thrust forward wont be known till after it
 happens. Just hoping for the best with that.</p>

<p>25 years ago I wrote an AI program for BP. The program learned the 
jobs of 45 different engineers and designers so well that in the end the
 PC sat on a desk in the middle of a room and performed all 45 job 
functions without the aid of an operator. An entire Engineering and 
design group. The program could recompile it's own coding when it 
figured something new out. It's easy enough to teach a computer just 
about anything a real person can do. Been doing this since 1974. IBM has
 some really cool cognizant API tools.</p>

<p>Very interesting.  I am a well-trained and highly skilled web 
searcher, and yet I find that however carefully I construct my search 
terms, using all of the available operators and filters, Google still 
misses the mark an astonishingly significant proportion of the time.  In
 fact, Google is a perfectly ROTTEN search engine, with its so-called 
"search results" being utterly corrupted and/or hijacked by 
considerations OTHER than their relevance to the query (read, commercial
 $$$$$$$$ who-paid-what considerations).</p><p>The Bible says that you cannot serve the gods of search and mammon (wealth) at the same time.</p><p>Here
 endeth the lesson.  Blessed be the almighty Euclid and his humble 
servant Boole forever.  Amen and hallelujiah.  Go in peace, my children.</p>
